# Week 5 â€” DynamoDB and Serverless Caching

## Work -

- Made `ddb.py` file for dynamo logic, like the PostGres `db.py` file
- Created script `list-users` that grabs and displays the cognito users


### Issues


CREATE , load, and seed REGULAR DB first, and then the ddb scripts will run because they rely on the 
Regular DB attributes.
