# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

## Homework

### Containers


troubleshoointg steps taken ===

app.py = NEEDS 2 more env variables

```
export FRONTEND_URL="*"
export BACKEND_URL="*"
```

Added the Dynamo local, postgres, and there volumes to the docker-compose file so it exists


- Docker extension with the right-click options for `compose start` and `compose stop` is very helpful

Docker exec command can actually be "ran" by right clicking the docker image on the docker extension list of images

FORGOT to append the /api/activities/home to the gitpod link so I was getting same error as before.

OPEN another terminal to view running docker images with `docker ps` .. I was wondering how to do this since on VScode there is only 1 terminal by default and it really annoyed me.

Personal challenges::

Github error thrown::

`fatal: Need to specify how to reconcile divergent branches.`

fixed by using command: `git config --global pull.ff true`
