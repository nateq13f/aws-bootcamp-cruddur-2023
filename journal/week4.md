## Postgres

1. Create RDS DB in AWS
2. Create DB cruddur
3. Created schema.sql file for the DB stucture
4. Created seed.sql file to add data into the tables
5. Created db-setup for ease of setting up a new local DB and schema

### Issues I ran into along the way --

- Not setting env var correctly
- Connection to RDS timing out due to not resetting the correct IP for the security group
