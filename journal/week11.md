## Toml setup

from /aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/
` gem install cfn-toml`


## DynamoDB CFN 

- Making DynamoSB CFN template from SAM because it is bascially short-hand CFN so it is more simple and easier to make.


### SAM ----->
Installed SAM and added SAM to gitpod file

Made 3 script files for DDB to build, package and deploy --

`bin/sam/ddb/build`
`bin/sam/ddb/package`
`bin/sam/ddb/deploy`
