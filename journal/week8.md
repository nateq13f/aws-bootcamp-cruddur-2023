# Week 8 â€” Serverless Image Processing

- `cdk synth` - just shows you in the console what CDK will create in your AWS environment.
- `cdk bootstrap` - Creates a CDK CFN stack for your REGION. You only need to run this once.
- Import dotenv file to CDK stack file with `import * as dotenv from 'dotenv'` and `dotenv.config();`
- Add ` cp .env.example .env` to gitpod file or CLI to copy CDK env vars to normal env vars

cd aws/lambdas/process-images
npm init -y
npm i sharp
- Install SDK for s3
npm i @aws-sdk/client-s3

ADDING Sharp because only Sharp is required, not the whole node.modules file--->
```
npm install
rm -rf node_modules/sharp
SHARP_IGNORE_GLOBAL_LIBVIPS=1 npm install --arch=x64 --platform=linux --libc=glibc sharp
```
Create new empty init files ----->
npm init -y
Delete --->
delete `node.modules` file


----- scripts required to run app succesfully -----
./bin/db/setup
./bin/ddb/schema-load
./bin/ddb/seed
./bin/db/migrate



- Add node_modules to `.gitignore` file


- Created assets bucket manually and imported it through CDK.
- Manually create the assets folder in assets bucket `original` and `processed`

ipnut env var of `DOMAIN_NAME` for serverless scripts

```
export DOMAIN_NAME=fireforeffect.live
gp env DOMAIN_NAME=fireforeffect.live
```

### Monitor the Lambda function process
- Create s3 event notification for PUT, for our use-case the cruddur app
- Lambda console -> Look at the Lambda trigger
- Look at the CloudWatch log group


### UPLOADING avatar setup for frontend

- Removed x-rays variables from `backend-flask.env` temporarily
```
AWS_XRAY_URL=*4567-nateq13f-awsbootcampcru-bdf1csl7gwh.ws-us94.gitpod.io*
AWS_XRAY_DAEMON_ADDRESS=xray-daemon:2000
```

- Create new sql query file call `show.sql` to pull user profile data

- Implement profile display
- Create `EditProfileButton.js` component just like `CrudButton.js` copmponent
and `EditProfileButton.css` to go along with it for the CSS part.

- Add `ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1`  to file `backend-flask/Dockerfile` to enable better logging for the python in backend.

### Creating  Edit Profile button -

- Create `frontend-react-js/jsconfig.json`  - changes source directory location
- Create `ProfileForm.js` file to create the actual profileform popup page
- Created `Popup.css` for additional css for profile editing
- Added endpoint to `app.py` for updating profile form
- Created `backend-flask/services/update_profile.py` in backend for DB connection
- Created `backend-flask/db/sql/users/udpate.sql` to update sql of profile updates

Made migrate and rollback scripts


### Implement and upload Avatar (part 1)

- Install SDK on frontend
`npm i @aws-sdk/client-s3 --save`

Made s3upload function in `ProfileForm.js` to uload avatar image


Pre-signed URL implementation == using Lambda and API gateway
HTTP API - 
Ruby Lambda -

create Ruby lambda file `aws/lambdas/cruddur-upload-avatar/function.rb`
cd into aws/lambdas/cruddur-upload-avatar and run `bundle init` to inti Ruby gemfile
ADD `gem "aws-sdk-s3"` to Gemfile
RUN `bundle install` to install that into Gemfile officially
To run function --> `bundle exec ruby function.rb`

- Install extension Thunder Client as a Postman alternative
This allows testing for API and even lambda locally before deploying it

- Created Lambda authorizer function for JWT token
Install `npm install aws-jwt-verify --save` in /lambdas/lambda-authorizer


### API gateway ==>

Routes
1. POST
/avatars/key_upload

2 lambdas --->
Athorization 
AND
Integration 

2. OPTIONS
/{proxy+}

1 lambda --->
Integration


### CORS SETUP

Added CORS policy to s3 avatars bucket --->>
```
[
    {
        "AllowedHeaders": [
            "*"
        ],
        "AllowedMethods": [
            "PUT"
        ],
        "AllowedOrigins": [
            "https://*.gitpod.com"
        ],
        "ExposeHeaders": [
            "x-amz-server-side-encryption",
            "x-amz-request-id",
            "x-amz-id-2"
        ],
        "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000
    }
]
```

API-Gateway no longer needs CORS since we are forwarding CORS headers in the code itself.

- Removing all console logging because troubleshooting is done, so no use for logging to console anymore.

- EDIT Lambda authorize with CORS updates for JWT


### Challenges --
- my buket name was named `cruddur-thumbs` when it should have been my own domains name, so I used `cdk destroy` to tear down all resources created by the CDK to start fresh and grab new env vars.
- Had to also reset the env var for THUMBING_BUCKET_NAME to my own domain `assets.fireforeffect.live`
- Lambda function NOT logging and throwing error during s3-put test
- BIG issue with Lambda NOT logging was solved by correcting my path in env vars, I ended it at /lambdas/.
`THUMBING_TOPIC_NAME="/workspace/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/aws/lambdas/process-images/"`

STUCK at ----->>

Lambda error in CloudWatch ->

    ]
}
```

FIXED ---- typo in lib CDK file, `PRCESS_HEIGHT`.. Lamnda resolves and processes correctly

- My cruddur-net somehow got deleted.. so I installed it again and my docker-compose went up.
